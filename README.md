Introduction
In the age of information, efficiently extracting relevant information from a vast collection of documents is crucial. This project aims to provide a sophisticated solution by integrating retrieval and generation capabilities, allowing the chatbot to understand and answer queries based on the content of provided documents.

Features
Document Ingestion: Load and process multiple documents in various formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT).
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models for accurate responses.
Natural Language Understanding: Advanced NLP techniques for understanding complex queries.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of documents and queries.
Architecture
The chatbot is built using the RAG architecture, which consists of:

Retriever: Identifies relevant passages from the document corpus.
Generator: Generates coherent and contextually accurate responses based on the retrieved passages.
